There are two rivalry universitiesï¼ŒUCrimson and URoyal, in this city. 

In 1939, URoyal was given a Victory Bell to its student body as a gift from the school's alumni association. Initially, their cheerleaders rang the bell after each point they got during their football games at home. 

For every student in UCrimson, we should not be tolerate the opponent's behaviour. You were selected as one of the Crimson Knights to leave URoyal an unforgettable lesson, and bring back the Victory Bell to slap their face in the coming local derby.

Find the key to the exhibition room and solve all the puzzles, open the front gate and escape with the Victory Bell before the guards coming back to get you!
